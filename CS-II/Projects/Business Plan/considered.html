      <i> Considered and Accepted ISP Proposals </i>

</div>

  <b> Automated Garden - adheesh-katru  </b> <br> 
 

      <i>
	I considered <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/adheesh-katru/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color: blue;">this</a> proposal because it was actually a project that I had initially decided to pursue on my own. I have always wanted to work with raspberry pi, and I thought this would be a very good opportunity to do so. I also like plants, but I do not care much about actually watering them, so this project seemed like an easy fix for a personal problem.
<br><br>
	I decided to reject this proposal because it is a very popular project that has been done by many, and I do not think the coding part of this project would be very challenging. There are many guides online that can be followed to complete this project, and I do not see much room for creativity. That being said, the project sounds enjoyable, and I wish it the best of luck.

<b>	Educative AI Games - bo-hong-chen  </b> <br>

      <i>
	I considered <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/bo-hong-chen/Digital%20Portfolio/webshop/plan.html" style="color:blue;">this</a> proposal because I am interested in AI and education, and this project hits both points. The concept of using simple games to teach others about such complex concepts interests me, and this sounds like a resource I can see others using and benefitting from.
<br><br>
	I decided to reject this proposal because I do not feel that I have enough knowledge about AI to be able to design such games, and I feel like I would end up using the majority of my time learning and not doing as much rather than learning while creating. Had I felt more comfortable with AI concepts, I might have been more apt to commit to this project.

      <b> SchoolFood - brett-kaplan </b> <br> 
 

      <i>
	I considered <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brett-kaplan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color:blue;">this</a> proposal because it was very similar to my own original proposal, and I felt that it would greatly benefit Allen High School. The lunch process at the high school is rather inconvenient and this inconvenience is something I have experienced firsthand.
<br><br>
	I decided to reject this proposal because I do not see Allen ISD implementing this in the near future. Additionally, the login features and security requirements necessitate the use of backend development which I am not entirely familiar with. I am also not as passionate about this cause as I am about the project that I decided.

<b>	School Planner - danelle-corbita </b> <br> 
 
      <i>

	I considered <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/danelle-corbita/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color:blue;">this</a> proposal because it was a project that I would personally use, so I can relate to the target audience as a tired and exhausted student. This project also has room to grow in terms of the features that can be added in the future, and I had quite a few ideas of my own.
<br><br>
	I decided to reject this proposal because there are many existing applications that already exist, and I personally use one that I am very satisfied with. I would also prefer to work in a group with atleast one person that I am familiar with and trust because I feel that a quality group is just as important as a quality project.

      <b>Coding Duolingo - devin-wingfield</b> <br> 
 

      <i>
	I considered <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/devin-wingfield/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color:blue;">this</a> proposal because I am a fan of Duolingo and would have loved a Duolingo-style app to learn code back when I first started learning Python. I am interested in working with education related apps and feel that this project has a lot of scope to grow in terms of features.
<br><br>
	I decided to reject this proposal because, after thinking about it a little more, I could not wrap my head around how a Duolingo-style app would be able to teach more complicated programming concepts, such as object-oriented programming, to a user. If this app is anything like Duolingo, I would imagine that the main emphasis would be on syntax, and I do not think programming syntax is something that really needs to be memorized in the age of Google. The business proposal was also not as thorough as I would have liked it to be, so I feel like there is information that I do not have.

      <b> Music Recognition - ishita-chowdhury</b> <br> 
 

      <i>
	I considered <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/ishita-chowdhury/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color:blue;">this</a> proposal because the concept of music recognition has always interested me, and this project was very unique in comparison to the other projects. Although projects similar to this already exist, I feel like it would have been a great learning experience in terms of actually creating it and building it from scratch.
<br><br>
	I decided to reject this proposal because, although it provides a great learning experience, I would love to work with something more education or social welfare related. Additionally, the business proposal appeared to be somewhat incomplete, and I cannot commit to a project without knowing all the details.

       <b> CS Social Media Platform - matthew-roman </b> <br> 
 

       <i>
	 I considered <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/matthew-roman/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color:blue;">this</a> proposal because it ties back to education and can potentially be very helpful to both students and mentors. Depending on how it is approached, it can be a useful platform with a very unique set of features.
<br><br>
	 I decided to reject this proposal because most social media platforms already do a sufficient job of connecting people on a global scale. Another concern I had with this project is usefulness. This project would only be useful if people chose to use it given that is essentially a type of social media platform, and as a budding developer, I would rather not create something that depends on other people using it to such a great extent. That being said, I wish the project the best of luck!
       </i><br><br>
      <b> AP Physics Resource - rupak-bhattacharya </b> <br> 
 

      <i>
	I considered <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.codermerlin.com/users/rupak-bhattacharya/Digital%2520Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%2520Plan/index.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1666933381359832&usg=AOvVaw0lB0ATxi0QckZvXwHg7bl4" style="color:blue;">this</a> proposal because, as a current and former AP Physics student, I can see myself using this and having benefitted from this in the past. AP Physics is indeed a challenging subject for the vast majority of students, and I really like the educational aspect of this project.
<br><br>
	I decided to reject this proposal because the majority of the time for this project would be spent on content writing rather than coding, and while there is nothing wrong with that, the skills needed to create this project do not align with what I want to gain out of the ISP this year.
	<br><br>
	<b>unIQue - mason-graham</b> <br> 
 

      <i>
	I heavily considered <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.codermerlin.com/users/mason-graham/Digital%2520Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%2520Plan/index.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1666935844864516&usg=AOvVaw2BYz_PDxz_BMakfqXEl1cG" style="color:blue;">this</a> proposal as my second choice because of its emphasis on mental health. I loved the chatbot idea, and I feel that making a collection of games would be very enjoyable and help me develop a good programming skill set.
<br><br>
	I decided to reject this proposal because I built a game for my ISP last year so I do not feel like I would be learning as much from this ISP as I would be from another. I am also planning on building a type of chatbot for my ISP for English this year, so I would like to try something different for this project.

      <b> ShelterSafe - onik-hoque </b> <br> 
 

      <i>
	I accepted <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/onik-hoque/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color:blue;">this</a> proposal because I really liked the concept and cause behind this app, and I am very excited to be working on something with so much scope to grow in terms of features and usability. I am familiar with the people in this group, and I also feel comfortable working with them and brainstorming with them. We have planned on implementing an offline feature in which we will use algorithms to predict the future state of certain shelters in specific conditions. A feature like that does not yet exist and would be very helpful during natural disasters should anything happen to the cell towers.
<br><br>
	My only concerns regarding this project are because of the complexity of the technology required to implement it and my own lack of experience working with app development, servers, and AI. I feel comfortable learning one new skill and then implementing it within this time frame, but to learn so many new skills without the help of an individual who already knows what they are doing is far too stressful and may not be as practical as I would want it to be. That being said, I feel like this project can be simplified if needed, and I really want to see this work.
