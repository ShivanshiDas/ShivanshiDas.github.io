      <b>
	(Software) Development Engineer  </b> <br>
      <i> Software Development Engineers primarily focus on the development, maintenance, testing, and enhancement of new or pre-existing code. Day to day tasks include developing and maintaining software, testing new software, introducing new features to stakeholders and customers, and improving code in terms of speed and scalability. Given my relative inexperience working with most technologies, my biggest obstacle in this role will be largely technical. There are so many new softwares being used on the daily and keeping up with them is no simple task. Additionally, optimizing code is different from developing it in that it takes a lot more in depth knowledge to be able to look at a program and assess not only what can be changed but also whether or not that change is one worth making. As my challenge in this role is largely inexperience, I would imagine that it would take time and effort to get a feel of how the software works. I would have to invest a lot of time in my education and research outside of class to be able to fill this role.

      <b>
	QA (Quality Assurance) Engineer  </b> <br>
      <i> Quality Assurance Engineers primarily focus on upholding industry standards and regulations for software and develop and analyse test scripts to maintain the quality of software. Quality Assurance Engineers are also responsible for ensuring that the final product is user friendly and assess test results to predict user behavior and possible bugs. Once again, my largest obstacle would be the technical portion of this role as I do not have much experience writing debugging scripts. However, I do have experience manually debugging my own programs and given my attention to detail and patient work style, I believe I would do quite well in this role. 
      </i> <br> <br>

      
      <b> Project Manager </b> <br>
      <i> Project Managers primarily focus on the scheduling, budgeting, execution, and delivery of software projects and see projects from start to finish. As in most other management positions, a Project Manager must not only be diplomatic in their approach to addressing interpersonal problems between and amongst team members but also stern in their expectations of others. As an individual with a strong time management and communication skills, I can see myself doing well in this role. Although I consider myself to be a strong communicator, I tend to sugarcoat my words when it is not needed, and I would have to be more clear n what I have to say to have the most success in this role. I personally enjoy planning and organizing both people and events, so I think I would really enjoy this position. </i> <br> <br>

      <b> Product Manager </b> <br>
      <i>Product Managers primarily focus on consumer needs, market analysis, and competitors to develop a marketable product and improve the product performance. Product managers must have strong communication skills are they are the main bridge between the client and software development team and work towards launching a useful and marketable product. Although our product has competitors, our offline and community input features make our product one that is truly unique, and I do not think it would be too difficult to work with such a product. I consider myself to be a thorough decision maker and take many factors into account before taking action thus I think I would do well in this position.
	      </i> <br> <br>
      <b> Release Engineer </b> <br>
      <i>Release Engineers primarily focus on the implementation of software in a production environment while also overseeing the compilation and version control process of the code. Release Engineers work with QA Engineers to make sure each version is ready for release and work with many teams to ensure that the product is released without issues. I do not have much experience in this role, and I struggle with GitHub at times, so I do not believe I would be the best fit for this role. However, I am willing to learn, and with enough Google and guidance, I think I could do decent in this role.

      <b> Scheduling Challenges </b> <br>
      <i> Our team is distributed over multiple classes and thus scheduling will be a little difficult. On a more fortunate note, most of the team members are familiar with each other, so communication should not be a problem. We will have to see how the tasks are split up to see how much of this can be doe individually and how much of this will require team meetings.     </i> <br> <br>
