      <b> Introduction</b>
      <div class="pg">

Decision making is the foundation of project management and development, and the presence of biases in decision making is as problematic as it is inevitable.  In a professional environment, it is essential that decisions be made in a rational manner and although it is natural for every team member to hold onto different thought processes, it is important to ensure that decisions are made independently of such biases. Placed into the context of the Independent Study Project for this year, decision making will determine whether or not our team is successful in terms of deadlines and task completion, and as a team, it is in our best interests to not only identify potential biases but to proactively handle them as well.
	<br> </div>
<b> Complexity Bias</b>
 <div class="pg"> 
The novel and high-pressure nature of the Independent Study Project makes it a breeding ground for Complexity bias. Complexity bias is an individual’s tendency to overcomplicate a simple task due to external factors such as stress and view the given task as having “many parts that are difficult to understand”. As a stress-prone individual, I can see my team and I getting overwhelmed over the course of this project, and the best way to counter feeling overwhelmed is by breaking the task at hand into smaller, more manageable pieces. Spreadsheets, to-do lists, and simple planners are effective in taking a broad task and dividing it into smaller steps and can help make overwhelming processes easier in terms of both task and stress management; very few things are truly as complicated as they seem. 
    <br> </div>
<b> Confirmation Bias </b>
 <div class="pg"> 
The prospect of making the wrong decision is nerve-racking, and confirmation bias is one of the many defense mechanisms individuals who fear decision making have developed to protect themselves from the process. Confirmation bias is a decision maker’s tendency to “seek confirmatory evidence” and disregard “disconfirming information”. While there is nothing wrong with searching for evidence to back a decision, selectively excluding inconvenient bits of information can be problematic in regards to the legitimacy of the given decision. I am one of the many people who use confirmation bias as a defense mechanism to avoid the feeling of making a faulty decision, and given the potential negative effects of this particular bias on the Independent Study Project, openly asking the team to actively find “disconfirming information” would be a systematic approach to removing this influence. <br> </div>
<b> Desire Bias </b>
<div class="pg"> 
While confidence is a key aspect of bringing any goal to fruition, overconfidence suppresses work ethic and can seriously hinder the completion of any set of tasks. Desire bias is a decision maker’s tendency to “overestimate success” despite being given “information that should abate their desire” and is strongly correlated to overconfidence and desire. As a relatively optimistic individual, I have overestimated the success of my endeavors in the past in part because of my desire to bring said endeavors to fruition. However, given the effects of overconfidence in long term projects, I will make a conscious effort to not only break down a task into smaller pieces but to also account for every possible challenge along the way to better grasp the difficulty of the job at hand. To stay grounded to reality, I will frequently ask for the input of both team members and mentors outside my team and avoid perceiving any task as easy until I have completed it. <br> </div>
<b> Control Bias </b>
 <div class="pg"> 
Everyone wants control in their life because control feels safe and everyone wants to feel safe. However, to accept that there are some factors that cannot be controlled is a skill in itself, and for people who cannot give up control, control bias can be seen as a coping mechanism to feign control over a situation in which an individual has no influence. Control bias is an individual’s tendency to believe they have more control over an event than is apparent and can be triggered by both extensive planning and forecasting. As someone who feels comfort in control, I make extensive to-do lists and planning guides to better grasp an upcoming event that I have little control over, and this false sense of control is similar to desire bias in its form of sabotaging a long term goal. Control bias can lead to overconfidence in fields that the individual feels that they have some control over which can lead to poorly made irrational decisions. To combat control bias, I will actively seek information that contradicts my opinion and be more aware of the factors that are out of my control. I will not assume control over any aspect of the project except for the parts that are directly assigned to me to complete. <br> </div>
<b> Escalation Bias </b>
 <div class="pg"> 
Learning to keep going in the face of adversity is an important challenge for any team; however, learning to give up and redirect when the costs of adversity outweigh the potential benefits of success is a skill that is no less important. Escalation bias is a decision maker’s tendency to “commit to follow or escalate a previous unsatisfactory course of action” oftentimes because the individual feels close to the “attainment of a goal” (). As someone who likes to see things through, escalation bias will be one of the most difficult biases for me to overcome. To sink so many investments into a goal and then see the goal slowly fail can be difficult to recover from but knowing when to cut losses and short term goals is necessary for the progression of long term goals. To limit escalation bias within my team, I will support the perception of quitting a failing goal as a success in itself and be open to starting fresh. Creating an environment in which everyone can openly state their opinion, both negative and positive, can help root out overcommitment in its earlier stages and keep escalation bias at bay. <br> </div>
<b> Conclusion </b>
 <div class="pg"> 
Biases are a human tendency, and while there is not much that can be done to completely eradicate them, learning to work with them and around them is important to the attainment of goals. With that being said, I am identifying potential biases with the intention of being able to avoid them in the future, and by avoiding said biases, I believe that I am giving the Independent Study Project it's best shot at gaining success. <br> </div>
