      <b> About </b>
      <i> This is a digital portfolio meant to display all of my progress as I move through highschool and onto other future endeavors. There have been many ups and many (more) downs, but beyond those, there have been many learning opportunities through which I have grown as both a student and soon-to-be profesional and the purpose of this portfolio is to present these ups and downs to future employers and my future self. This portfolio is not a presentation of my best work but rather a presentation of my progress as each new upload outdoes the one preceding it. </i> <br> <br>

    <i> Beyond the benefit of creating a digital platform through which I can present myself to future employers, I have also had the benefit of coding this page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I have worked with such languages in the past, this is my first time putting them together on such a large scale, and I have without a doubt learned many new skills from this proccess alone. Like myself, this digital portfolio is dynamic and will continue to change as I progress through my career. That being said, thank you for viewing my page and be sure to come back to see what I do next! </i>
