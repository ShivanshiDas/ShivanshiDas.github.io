      <i> Our motivation throughout the game included our shared love for the Minion movies and the many different forms of the running man game that we grew up playing. We wanted to provide a simple yet entertaining game to kill time with, and we feel that, given the time and resources available, we have done better than we first imagined. We wanted to go beyond the more traditional games and have fun with this project. Given more time, we would have liked to make the interface more aesthetically pleasing.  </i>
