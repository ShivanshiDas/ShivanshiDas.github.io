      <i> I am currently a part of National Honor Society, Spanish Honor Society, and Computer Science Honor Society and work as a tutor and coding instructor for younger students in my community. I am the Vice President for Girls(/Guys) Who Code and cannot wait to see what we accomplish as a club this year. I was a CS1 student last year, and I was fortunate to have learned a lot about how Computer Science is applied in a professional and team setting. CS1 was also an effective test of my time management skills as a student, and I hope to apply such skills in CS2 this year. I like coding when it likes me back, and I hope to make a career out of it because computer science is my pa$$ion &lt;3 I have also recently joined the STEAM Center App Project as a Mobile App Programmer, so I am looking forward to expanding my programming knowledge with this experience. While I do love my friends, I also love staying in, and I love my bed. I love taking naps and am beyond grateful for every nap I have ever taken. I work better when I am well rested, and I believe everyone should get more sleep. I enjoy spending time with my family, and I spend a lot of my time hanging out with my sister. </i> <!-- click here to take a nap -->
