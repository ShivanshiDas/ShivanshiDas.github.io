    <blockquote>
      <i>The original concept of the game included a character and a board with the end goal being to reach the end of the screen without falling off any one of the buildings. The codebase was to be organized using Object Oriented Programming concepts and the controls were to be left simple. The height of the board would increase every time the player hit x, and once the player was satisfied with the length of the board, the player was to hit f for fall. If the board was too short, the character would fall before reaching the next building and if the board was too long, the character would walk off the next building and plummet to a certain death upon which the game would end.
