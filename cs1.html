<b> ADV CS1 </b> <br>
      <i>  Advanced Computer Science 1 was my first formal cs course in highschool and covered a vast array of topics including the computer, computer architecture, Boolean algebra, binary and other number systems, and data types and representations. The class was largely focused on Swift but incuded HTML and CSS to varying degrees.The highlight of CS1 was most definetly the ISP in which my classmates and I created MinionScapes. CS1 was also the first time I worked with Git and GitHub, and, although I did not know what I was doing, the exposure was helpful going into CS2. CS1 also introduced me to Girls Who Code and CS Club in general. </i>
