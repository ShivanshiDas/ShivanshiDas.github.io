	<i> This ISP was the first project I did on such a scale, and I have learned far more from this experience than I could have predicted. Almost nothing went as predicted, with problems following my team and I through every step of the way, but many of these problems were resolved, leaving us with priceless bits of knowledge that we hope to apply to coming projects. Git and GitHub did not work for us as we were not well aware of how to properly work with it, and so we faced many issues whie pushing and pulling code. File handling was another challenge we had initially faced, but, luckily, it wasone that mostly sorted itself out over time. There are many things I would do differently, were I do redo this project now, and this code is not the finest piece of code I will write, but the learning oppurtunity was invaluable and a first for many more to come. </i>   </blockquote>
